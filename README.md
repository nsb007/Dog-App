# Dog App Using CNN and Transfer Learning (ResNet-50)

The application developed can be deployed to mobile or web, is code that will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
